# Sprite Shape Generator
A tool inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/shaunspalding" target="_blank">Shaun Spalding's</a> lighting system video to define shapes in sprites and save them as simple coordinates in a text file in a very fast and easy way.

# How to use
All you have to do is select a .png file from your computer and the game will import it in, after that you can just simply click around its outline and save once you're done, it'll open a .txt file with all the coordinates placed in one line ready to be copied and pasted into your projects.
